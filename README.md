🛳️ Titanic Survival Prediction – Machine Learning Project

📌 Project Overview
This project is based on the famous Titanic Survival Prediction challenge. The objective is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger would survive the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, gender, ticket class, family size, and more.

The project demonstrates the end-to-end ML pipeline:

Data preprocessing & cleaning
Feature engineering
Model building & evaluation
Ensemble methods for boosting performance
Model interpretability (feature importance & SHAP analysis)

The best performing model achieved an accuracy of ~88%, outperforming many baseline approaches.

🔍 Dataset
The dataset comes from the Kaggle Titanic competition
, which includes information about passengers such as:

PassengerId, Pclass, Name, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Ticket, Fare, Cabin, Embarked
Target variable: Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

⚙️ Steps & Methodology
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Survival rates by gender, passenger class, age group, embarkation point
Visualizations using Seaborn & Matplotlib
Correlation heatmaps to identify important relationships

2. Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values (Age, Cabin, Embarked)
Encoding categorical variables (Sex, Embarked, Pclass)
Scaling continuous features (Age, Fare)

3. Feature Engineering

Extracted Title from passenger names (Mr, Mrs, Miss, etc.)
Created FamilySize = (SibSp + Parch + 1)
Added IsAlone feature

4. Modeling

Tested multiple models, including:

Logistic Regression
Linear Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Gradient Boosting (GBM)
XGBoost
Stacking Ensemble

5. Evaluation

Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
Best model: Ensemble method (Stacking/Boosting) with ~88% accuracy
Feature importance analysis with SHAP to interpret the model

📊 Results

Baseline models achieved 70–80% accuracy.
Feature engineering and ensemble learning significantly improved results.
Final accuracy: ~88%.

Key influential features: Sex, Pclass, Age, Title, FamilySize.

🌟 Enhancements

Compared multiple models systematically.
Used stacking/ensemble for better performance.
Added SHAP explainability to understand feature influence.
Designed modular code for reusability and future deployment.

🚀 Next Steps (Future Work)

Deploy the model on Streamlit/Gradio to create a user-friendly web app.

Build an interactive dashboard for Titanic dataset insights (Plotly/Dash).

Explore deep learning approaches for comparison.
